# OC_suite
Creative suite compiled with FOSS

This is a creative suite compiled out of GIMP, Krita, FreeCAD and Blender. 
It is for now primarily aimed at production design but may expand in the future.
It is based on a bash script that installs GIMP, Krita, FreeCAD and Blender. 
This bash script also installs themes to unify the look of the programs. 

This is still a work in progress and im still working out the bugs, so run and install at your own risk.
